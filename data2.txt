you ask it of course you have the right sometimes i ask it too why paul never succeeded while we were struggling along the things that held him back seemed only details only now do i see them as a whole in the first place paul never aimed directly at success he was allround if it had been merely a question of exploiting his talent sticking to the one idea day in day out never letting an opportunity slip by of meeting the right people and getting to the right places  that would have been easy he had tremendous energy i used to grudge his interest in other things i hated to see him lose the chances and let them be snapped up by littler men he seemed to waste himself right and left prodigally but it wasnt that it wasnt waste it was all as much a part of him as his music he detested the stupidity of wealth and poverty he rebelled against laws that arent laws but only interests enforced by authority he fought against the sheer deadness of prejudice how he hated all that and why not you see vera he was sensitive to it not only as a thinker but as a musician too it was all a part of the discord and what i used to think his wasting himself was really an effort to create a larger harmony he used to say that the beauty of music is only the image of beauty in life and that life must come first he couldnt endure discords anywhere paul despised the musicians who scream at a flatted f but hunger for the flesh pots after the performance no he was never that and people resented it the very people who ought to have understood
