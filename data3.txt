szethsonsonvallano truthless of shinovar wore white on the day he was to kill a king the white clothing was a parshendi tradition foreign to him but he did as his masters required and did not ask for an explanation he sat in a large stone room baked by enormous firepits that cast a garish light upon the revelers causing beads of sweat to form on their skin as they danced and drank and yelled and sang and clapped some fell to the ground redfaced the revelry too much for them their stomachs proving to be inferior wineskins they looked as if they were dead at least until their friends carried them out of the feast hall to waiting beds szeth did not sway to the drums drink the sapphire wine or stand to dance he sat on a bench at the back a still servant in white robes few at the treatysigning celebration noticed him he was just a servant and shin were easy to ignore most out here in the east thought szeths kind were docile and harmless they were generally right the drummers began a new rhythm the beats shook szeth like a quartet of thumping hearts pumping waves of invisible blood through the room szeths masterswho were dismissed as savages by those in more civilized kingdomssat at their own tables they were men with skin of black marbled with red parshendi they were namedcousins to the more docile servant peoples known as parshmen in most of the world an oddity they did not call themselves parshendi this was the alethi name for them it meant roughly parshmen who can think neither side seemed to see that as an insult the parshendi had brought the musicians at first the alethi lighteyes had been hesitant to them drums were base instruments of the common darkeyed people but wine was the great assassin of both tradition and propriety and now the alethi elite danced with abandon szeth stood and began to pick his way through the room the revelry had lasted long even the king had retired hours ago but many still celebrated as he walked szeth was forced to step around dalinar kholinthe kings own brotherwho slumped drunken at a small table the aging but powerfully built man kept waving away those who tried to encourage him to bed where was jasnah the kings daughter elhokar the kings son and heir sat at the high table ruling the feast in his fathers absence he was in conversation with two men a darkskinned azish man who had an odd patch of pale skin on his cheek and a thinner alethilooking man who kept glancing over his shoulder the heirs feasting companions were unimportant szeth stayed far from the heir skirting the sides of the room passing the drummers musicspren zipped through the air around them the tiny spirits taking the form of spinning translucent ribbons as szeth passed the drummers they noted him they would withdraw soon along with all of the other parshendi they did not seem offended they did not seem angry and yet they were going to break their treaty of only a few hours it made no sense but szeth did not ask questions at the edge of the room he passed rows of unwavering azure lights that bulged out where wall met floor they held sapphires infused with stormlight profane how could the men of these lands use something so sacred for mere illumination worse the alethi scholars were said to be close to creating new shardblades szeth hoped that was just wishful boasting for if it did happen the world would be changed likely in a way that ended with people in all countriesfrom distant thaylenah to towering jah kevedspeaking alethi to their children they were a grand people these alethi even drunk there was a natural nobility to them tall and well made the men dressed in dark silk coats that buttoned down the sides of the chest and were elaborately embroidered in silver or gold each one looked a general on the field the women were even more splendid they wore grand silk dresses tightly fitted the bright colors a contrast to the dark tones favored by the men the left sleeve of each dress was longer than the right one covering the hand alethi had an odd sense of propriety their pure black hair was pinned up atop their heads either in intricate weavings of braids or in loose piles it was often woven with gold ribbons or ornaments along with gems that glowed with stormlight beautiful profane but beautiful szeth left the feasting chamber behind just outside he passed the doorway into the beggars feast it was an alethi tradition a room where some of the poorest men and women in the city were given a feast complementing that of the king and his guests a man with a long grey and black beard slumped in the doorway smiling foolishlythough whether from wine or a weak mind szeth could not tell have you seen me the man asked with slurred speech he laughed then began to speak in gibberish reaching for a wineskin so it was drink after all szeth brushed by continuing past a line of statues depicting the ten heralds from ancient vorin theology jezerezeh ishi kelek talenelat he counted off each one and realized there were only nine here one was conspicuously missing why had shalashs statue been removed king gavilar was said to be very devout in his vorin worship too devout by some peoples standards the hallway here curved to the right running around the perimeter of the domed palace they were on the kings floor two levels up surrounded by rock walls ceiling and floor that was profane stone was not to be trod upon but what was he to do he was truthless he did as his masters demanded today that included wearing white loose white trousers tied at the waist with a rope and over them a filmy shirt with long sleeves open at the front white clothing for a killer was a tradition among the parshendi although szeth had not asked his masters had explained why white to be bold white to not blend into the night white to give warning for if you were going to assassinate a man he was entitled to see you coming szeth turned right taking the hallway directly toward the kings chambers torches burned on the walls their light unsatisfying to him a meal of thin broth after a long fast tiny flamespren danced around them like insects made solely of congealed light the torches were useless to him he reached for his pouch and the spheres it contained but then hesitated when he saw more of the blue lights ahead a pair of stormlight lamps hanging on the wall brilliant sapphires glowing at their hearts szeth walked up to one of these holding out his hand to cup it around the glassshrouded gemstone you there a voice called in alethi there were two guards at the intersection double guard for there were savages abroad in kholinar this night true those savages were supposed to be allies now but alliances could be shallow things indeed this one wouldnt last the hour szeth looked as the two guards approached they carried spears they werent lighteyes and were therefore forbidden the sword their painted red breastplates were ornate however as were their helms they might be darkeyed but they were highranking citizens with honored positions in the royal guard stopping a few feet away the guard at the front gestured with his spear go on now this is no place for you he had tan alethi skin and a thin mustache that ran all the way around his mouth becoming a beard at the bottom szeth didnt move well the guard said what are you waiting for szeth breathed in deeply drawing forth the stormlight it streamed into him siphoned from the twin sapphire lamps on the walls sucked in as if by his deep inhalation the stormlight raged inside of him and the hallway suddenly grew darker falling into shade like a hilltop cut off from the sun by a transient cloud szeth could feel the lights warmth its fury like a tempest that had been injected directly into his veins the power of it was invigorating but dangerous it pushed him to act to move to strike holding his breath he clung to the stormlight he could still feel it leaking out stormlight could be held for only a short time a few minutes at most it leaked away the human body too porous a container he had heard that the voidbringers could hold it in perfectly but then did they even exist his punishment declared that they didnt his honor demanded that they did afire with holy energy szeth turned to the guards they could see that he was leaking stormlight wisps of it curling from his skin like luminescent smoke the lead guard squinted frowning szeth was sure the man had never seen anything like it before as far as he knew szeth had killed every stonewalker who had ever seen what he could do what what are you the guards voice had lost its certainty spirit or man what am i szeth whispered a bit of light leaking from his lips as he looked past the man down the long hallway im sorry szeth blinked lashing himself to that distant point down the hallway stormlight raged from him in a flash chilling his skin and the ground immediately stopped pulling him downward instead he was pulled toward that distant pointit was as if to him that direction had suddenly become down this was a basic lashing first of his three kinds of lashings it gave him the ability to manipulate what ever force spren or god it was that held men to the ground with this lashing he could bind people or objects to different surfaces or in different directions from szeths perspective the hallway was now a deep shaft down which he was falling and the two guards stood on one of the sides they were shocked when szeths feet hit them one for each face throwing them over szeth shifted his view and lashed himself to the floor light leaked from him the floor of the hallway again became down and he landed between the two guards clothes crackling and dropping flakes of frost he rose beginning the process of summoning his shardblade one of the guards fumbled for his spear szeth reached down touching the soldiers shoulder while looking up he focused on a point above him while willing the light out of his body and into the guard lashing the poor man to the ceiling the guard yelped in shock as up became down for him light trailing from his form he crashed into the ceiling and dropped his spear it was not lashed directly and clattered back down to the floor near szeth to kill it was the greatest of sins and yet here szeth stood truthless profanely walking on stones used for building and it would not end as truthless there was only one life he was forbidden to take and that was his own at the tenth beat of his heart his shardblade dropped into his waiting hand it formed as if condensing from mist water beading along the metal length his shardblade was long and thin edged on both sides smaller than most others szeth swept it out carving a line in the stone floor and passing through the second guards neck as always the shardblade killed oddly though it cut easily through stone steel or anything inanimate the metal fuzzed when it touched living skin it traveled through the guards neck without leaving a mark but once it did the mans eyes smoked and burned they blackened shriveling up in his head and he slumped forward dead a shardblade did not cut living flesh it severed the soul itself above the first guard gasped hed managed to get to his feet even though they were planted on the ceiling of the hallway shardbearer he shouted a shardbearer assaults the kings hall to arms finally szeth thought szeths use of stormlight was unfamiliar to the guards but they knew a shardblade when they saw one szeth bent down and picked up the spear that had fallen from above as he did so he released the breath hed been holding since drawing in the stormlight it sustained him while he held it but those two lanterns hadnt contained much of it so he would need to breathe again soon the light began to leak away more quickly now that he wasnt holding his breath szeth set the spears butt against the stone floor then looked upward the guard above stopped shouting eyes opening wide as the tails of his shirt began to slip downward the earth below reasserting its dominance the light steaming off his body dwindled he looked down at szeth down at the spear tip pointing directly at his heart violet fearspren crawled out of the stone ceiling around him the light ran out the guard fell he screamed as he hit the spear impaling him through the chest szeth let the spear fall away carried to the ground with a muffled thump by the body twitching on its end shardblade in hand he turned down a side corridor following the map hed memorized he ducked around a corner and flattened himself against the wall just as a troop of guards reached the dead men the newcomers began shouting immediately continuing the alarm his instructions were clear kill the king but be seen doing it let the alethi know he was coming and what he was doing why why did the parshendi agree to this treaty only to send an assassin the very night of its signing more gemstones glowed on the walls of the hallway here king gavilar liked lavish display and he couldnt know that he was leaving sources of power for szeth to use in his lashings the things szeth did hadnt been seen for millennia histories from those times were all but nonexistent and the legends were horribly inaccurate szeth peeked back out into the corridor one of the guards at the intersection saw him pointing and yelling szeth made sure they got a good look then ducked away he took a deep breath as he ran drawing in stormlight from the lanterns his body came alive with it and his speed increased his muscles bursting with energy light became a storm inside of him his blood thundered in his ears it was terrible and wonderful at the same time two corridors down one to the side he threw open the door of a storage room then hesitated a momentjust long enough for a guard to round the corner and see himbefore dashing into the room preparing for a full lashing he raised his arm and commanded the stormlight to pool there causing the skin to burst alight with radiance then he flung his hand out toward the doorframe spraying white luminescence across it like paint he slammed the door just as the guards arrived the stormlight held the door in the frame with the strength of a hundred arms a full lashing bound objects together holding them fast until the stormlight ran out it took longer to createand drained stormlight far more quicklythan a basic lashing the door handle shook and then the wood began to crack as the guards threw their weight against it one man calling for an axe szeth crossed the room in rapid strides weaving around the shrouded furniture that had been stored here it was of red cloth and deep expensive woods he reached the far wall andpreparing himself for yet another blasphemyhe raised his shardblade and slashed horizontally through the dark grey stone the rock sliced easily a shardblade could cut any inanimate object two vertical slashes followed then one across the bottom cutting a large square block he pressed his hand against it willing stormlight into the stone behind him the rooms door began to crack he looked over his shoulder and focused on the shaking door lashing the block in that direction frost crystallized on his clothinglashing something so large required a great deal of stormlight the tempest within him stilled like a storm reduced to a drizzle he stepped aside the large stone block shuddered sliding into the room normally moving the block would have been impossible its own weight would have held it against the stones below yet now that same weight pulled it free for the block the direction of the rooms door was down with a deep grinding sound the block slid free of the wall and tumbled through the air smashing furniture the soldiers finally broke through the door staggering into the room just as the enormous block crashed into them szeth turned his back on the terrible sound of the screams the splintering of wood the breaking of bones he ducked and stepped through his new hole entering the hallway outside he walked slowly drawing stormlight from the lamps he passed siphoning it to him and stoking anew the tempest within as the lamps dimmed the corridor darkened a thick wooden door stood at the end and as he approached small fearsprenshaped like globs of purple goobegan to wriggle from the masonry pointing toward the doorway they were drawn by the terror being felt on the other side szeth pushed the door open entering the last corridor leading to the kings chambers tall red ceramic vases lined the pathway and they were interspersed with nervous soldiers they flanked a long narrow rug it was red like a river of blood the spearmen in front didnt wait for him to get close they broke into a trot lifting their short throwing spears szeth slammed his hand to the side pushing stormlight into the doorframe using the third and final type of lashing a reverse lashing this one worked diff erently from the other two it did not make the doorframe emit stormlight indeed it seemed to pull nearby light into it giving it a strange penumbra the spearmen threw and szeth stood still hand on the doorframe a reverse lashing required his constant touch but took comparatively little stormlight during one anything that approached himparticularly lighter objectswas instead pulled toward the lashing itself the spears veered in the air splitting around him and slamming into the wooden frame as he felt them hit szeth leaped into the air and lashed himself to the right wall his feet hitting the stone with a slap he immediately re oriented his perspective to his eyes he wasnt standing on the wall the soldiers were the bloodred carpet streaming between them like a long tapestry szeth bolted down the hallway striking with his shardblade shearing through the necks of two men who had thrown spears at him their eyes burned and they collapsed the other guards in the hallway began to panic some tried to attack him others yelled for more help still others cringed away from him the attackers had troublethey were disoriented by the oddity of striking at someone who hung on the wall szeth cut down a few then flipped into the air tucking into a roll and lashed himself back to the floor he hit the ground in the midst of the soldiers completely surrounded but holding a shardblade according to legend the shardblades were first carried by the knights radiant uncounted ages ago gifts of their god granted to allow them to fight horrors of rock and flame dozens of feet tall foes whose eyes burned with hatred the voidbringers when your foe had skin as hard as stone itself steel was useless something supernal was required szeth rose from his crouch loose white clothes rippling jaw clenched against his sins he struck out his weapon flashing with reflected torchlight elegant wide swings three of them one after another he could neither close his ears to the screams that followed nor avoid seeing the men fall they dropped round him like toys knocked over by a childs careless kick if the blade touched a mans spine he died eyes burning if it cut through the core of a limb it killed that limb one soldier stumbled away from szeth arm flopping uselessly on his shoulder he would never be able to feel it or use it again szeth lowered his shardblade standing among the cindereyed corpses here in alethkar men often spoke of the legendsof mankinds hardwon victory over the voidbringers but when weapons created to fight nightmares were turned against common soldiers the lives of men became cheap things indeed szeth turned and continued on his way slippered feet falling on the soft red rug the shardblade as always glistened silver and clean when one killed with a blade there was no blood that seemed like a sign the shardblade was just a tool it could not be blamed for the murders the door at the end of the hallway burst open szeth froze as a small group of soldiers rushed out ushering a man in regal robes his head ducked as if to avoid arrows the soldiers wore deep blue the color of the kings guard and the corpses didnt make them stop and gawk they were prepared for what a shardbearer could do they opened a side door and shoved their ward through several leveling spears at szeth as they backed out another figure stepped from the kings quarters he wore glistening blue armor made of smoothly interlocking plates unlike common plate armor however this armor had no leather or mail visible at the joints just smaller plates fitting together with intricate precision the armor was beautiful the blue inlaid with golden bands around the edges of each piece of plate the helm ornamented with three waves of small hornlike wings shardplate the customary complement to a shardblade the newcomer carried a sword as well an enormous shardblade six feet long with a design along the blade like burning flames a weapon of silvery metal that gleamed and almost seemed to glow a weapon designed to slay dark gods a larger counterpart to the one szeth carried szeth hesitated he didnt recognize the armor he had not been warned that he would be set at this task and hadnt been given proper time to memorize the various suits of plate or blades owned by the alethi but a shardbearer would have to be dealt with before he chased the king he could not leave such a foe behind besides perhaps a shardbearer could defeat him kill him and end his miserable life his lashings wouldnt work directly on someone in shardplate and the armor would enhance the man strengthen him szeths honor would not allow him to betray his mission or seek death but if that death occurred he would welcome it the shardbearer struck and szeth lashed himself to the side of the hallway leaping with a twist and landing on the wall he danced backward blade held at the ready the shardbearer fell into an aggressive posture using one of the swordplay stances favored here in the east he moved far more nimbly than one would expect for a man in such bulky armor shardplate was special as ancient and magical as the blades it complemented the shardbearer struck szeth skipped to the side and lashed himself to the ceiling as the shardbearers blade sliced into the wall feeling a thrill at the contest szeth dashed forward and attacked downward with an overhand blow trying to hit the shardbearers helm the man ducked going down on one knee letting szeths blade cleave empty air szeth leaped backward as the shardbearer swung upward with his blade slicing into the ceiling szeth didnt own a set of plate himself and didnt care to his lashings interfered with the gemstones that powered shardplate and he had to choose one or the other as the shardbearer turned szeth sprinted forward across the ceiling as expected the shardbearer swung again and szeth leaped to the side rolling he came up from his roll and flipped lashing himself to the floor again he spun to land on the ground behind the shardbearer he slammed his blade into his opponents open back unfortunately there was one major advantage plate offered it could block a shardblade szeths weapon hit solidly causing a web of glowing lines to spread out across the back of the armor and stormlight began to leak free from them shardplate didnt dent or bend like common metal szeth would have to hit the shardbearer in the same location at least once more to break through szeth danced out of range as the shardbearer swung in anger trying to cut at szeths knees the tempest within szeth gave him many advantages including the ability to quickly recover from small wounds but it would not restore limbs killed by a shardblade he rounded the shardbearer then picked a moment and dashed forward the shardbearer swung again but szeth briefly lashed himself to the ceiling for lift he shot into the air cresting over the swing then immediately lashed himself back to the floor he struck as he landed but the shardbearer recovered quickly and executed a perfect followthrough stroke coming within a finger of hitting szeth the man was dangerously skilled with that blade many shardbearers depended too much on the power of their weapon and armor this man was different szeth jumped to the wall and struck at the shardbearer with quick terse attacks like a snapping eel the shardbearer fended him off with wide sweeping counters his blades length kept szeth at bay this is taking too long szeth thought if the king slipped away into hiding szeth would fail in his mission no matter how many people he killed he ducked in for another strike but the shardbearer forced him back each second this fight lasted was another for the kings escape it was time to be reckless szeth launched into the air lashing himself to the other end of the hallway and falling feetfirst toward his adversary the shardbearer didnt hesitate to swing but szeth lashed himself down at an angle dropping immediately the shardblade swished through the air above him he landed in a crouch using his momentum to throw himself forward and swung at the shardbearers side where the plate had cracked he hit with a powerful blow that piece of the plate shattered bits of molten metal streaking away the shardbearer grunted dropping to one knee raising a hand to his side szeth raised a foot to the mans side and shoved him backward with a stormlightenhanced kick the heavy shardbearer crashed into the door of the kings quarters smashing it and falling partway into the room beyond szeth left him ducking instead through the doorway to the right following the way the king had gone the hallway here had the same red carpet and stormlight lamps on the walls gave szeth a chance to recharge the tempest within energy blazed within him again and he sped up if he could get far enough ahead he could deal with the king then turn back to fight off the shardbearer it wouldnt be easy a full lashing on a doorway wouldnt stop a shardbearer and that plate would let the man run supernaturally fast szeth glanced over his shoulder the shardbearer wasnt following the man sat up in his armor looking dazed szeth could just barely see him sitting in the doorway surrounded by broken bits of wood perhaps szeth had wounded him more than hed thought or maybe szeth froze he thought of the ducked head of the man whod been rushed out face obscured the shardbearer still wasnt following he was so skilled it was said that few men could rival gavilar kholins swordsmanship could it be szeth turned and dashed back trusting his instincts as soon as the shardbearer saw him he climbed to his feet with alacrity szeth ran faster what was the safest place for your king in the hands of some guards fleeing or protected in a suit of shardplate left behind dismissed as a bodyguard clever szeth thought as the formerly sluggish shardbearer fell into another battle stance szeth attacked with renewed vigor swinging his blade in a flurry of strikes the shardbearerthe kingaggressively struck out with broad sweeping blows szeth pulled away from one of these feeling the wind of the weapon passing just inches before him he timed his next move then dashed forward ducking underneath the kings followthrough the king expecting another strike at his side twisted with his arm held protectively to block the hole in his plate that gave szeth the room to run past him and into the kings chambers the king spun around to follow but szeth ran through the lavishly furnished chamber flinging out his hand touching pieces of furniture he passed he infused them with stormlight lashing them to a point behind the king the furniture tumbled as if the room had been turned on its side couches chairs and tables dropping toward the surprised king gavilar made the mistake of chopping at them with his shardblade the weapon easily sheared through a large couch but the pieces still crashed into him making him stumble a footstool hit him next throwing him to the ground gavilar rolled out of the way of the furniture and charged forward plate leaking streams of light from the cracked sections szeth gathered himself then leaped into the air lashing himself backward and to the right as the king arrived he zipped out of the way of the kings blow then lashed himself forward with two basic lashings in a row stormlight flashed out of him clothing freezing as he was pulled toward the king at twice the speed of a normal fall the kings posture indicated surprise as szeth lurched in midair then spun toward him swinging he slammed his blade into the kings helm then immediately lashed himself to the ceiling and fell upward slamming into the stone roof above hed lashed himself in too many directions too quickly and his body had lost track making it difficult to land gracefully he stumbled back to his feet below the king stepped back trying to get into position to swing up at szeth the mans helm was cracked leaking stormlight and he stood protectively defending the side with the broken plate the king used a onehanded swing reaching for the ceiling szeth immediately lashed himself downward judging that the kings attack would leave him unable to get his sword back in time szeth underestimated his opponent the king stepped into szeths attack trusting his helm to absorb the blow just as szeth hit the helm a second timeshattering itgavilar punched with his off hand slamming his gauntleted fist into szeths face blinding light flashed in szeths eyes a counterpoint to the sudden agony that crashed across his face everything blurred his vision fading pain so much pain he screamed stormlight leaving him in a rush and he slammed back into something hard the balcony doors more pain broke out across his shoulders as if someone had stabbed him with a hundred daggers and he hit the ground and rolled to a stop muscles trembling the blow would have killed an ordinary man no time for pain no time for pain no time for pain he blinked shaking his head the world blurry and dark was he blind no it was dark outside he was on the wooden balcony the force of the blow had thrown him through the doors something was thumping heavy footfalls the shardbearer szeth stumbled to his feet vision swimming blood streamed from the side of his face and stormlight rose from his skin blinding his left eye the light it would heal him if it could his jaw felt unhinged broken hed dropped his shardblade a lumbering shadow moved in front of him the shardbearers armor had leaked enough stormlight that the king was having trouble walking but he was coming szeth screamed kneeling infusing stormlight into the wooden balcony lashing it downward the air frosted around him the tempest roared traveling down his arms into the wood he lashed it downward then did it again he lashed a fourth time as gavilar stepped onto the balcony it lurched under the extra weight the wood cracked straining the shardbearer hesitated szeth lashed the balcony downward a fifth time the balcony supports shattered and the entire structure broke free from the building szeth screamed through a broken jaw and used his final bit of stormlight to lash himself to the side of the building he fell to the side passing the shocked shardbearer then hit the wall and rolled the balcony dropped away the king looking up with shock as he lost his footing the fall was brief in the moonlight szeth watched solemnly vision still fuzzy blinded in one eyeas the structure crashed to the stone ground below the wall of the palace trembled and the crash of broken wood echoed from the nearby buildings still standing on the side of the wall szeth groaned climbing to his feet he felt weak hed used up his stormlight too quickly straining his body he stumbled down the side of the building approaching the wreckage barely able to remain standing the king was still moving shardplate would protect a man from such a fall but a large length of bloodied wood stuck up through gavilars side piercing him where szeth had broken the plate earlier szeth knelt down inspecting the mans painwracked face strong features square chin black beard flecked with white striking pale green eyes gavilar kholin i expected you to come the king said between gasps szeth reached underneath the front of the mans breastplate tapping the straps there they unfastened and he pulled the front of the breastplate free exposing the gemstones on its interior two had been cracked and burned out three still glowed numb szeth breathed in sharply absorbing the light the storm began to rage again more light rose from the side of his face repairing his damaged skin and bones the pain was still great stormlight healing was far from instantaneous it would be hours before he recovered the king coughed you can tell thaidakar that hes too late i dont know who that is szeth said standing his words slurring from his broken jaw he held his hand to the side resummoning his shardblade the king frowned then who restares sadeas i never thought my masters are the parshendi szeth said ten heartbeats passed and his blade dropped into his hand wet with condensation the parshendi that makes no sense gavilar coughed hand quivering reaching toward his chest and fumbling at a pocket he pulled out a small crystalline sphere tied to a chain you must take this they must not get it he seemed dazed tell tell my brother he must find the most important words a man can say gavilar fell still szeth hesitated then knelt down and took the sphere it was odd unlike any hed seen before though it was completely dark it seemed to glow somehow with a light that was black the parshendi gavilar had said that makes no sense nothing makes sense anymore szeth whispered tucking the strange sphere away its all unraveling i am sorry king of the alethi i doubt that you care not anymore at least he stood up at least you wont have to watch the world ending with the rest of us beside the kings body his shardblade materialized from mist clattering to the stones now that its master was dead it was worth a fortune kingdoms had fallen as men vied to possess a single shardblade shouts of alarm came from inside the palace szeth needed to go but tell my brother to szeths people a dying request was sacred he took the kings hand dipping it in the mans own blood then used it to scrawl on the wood brother you must find the most important words a man can say with that szeth escaped into the night he left the kings shardblade he had no use for it the blade szeth already carried was curse enough
